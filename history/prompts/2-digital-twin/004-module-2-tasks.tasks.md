# Prompt History Record: Module 2 Task Breakdown

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Assistant Response (RESPONSE_TEXT)

Created a comprehensive task breakdown for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) following the required format with:

- 74 total tasks organized across 7 phases
- Strict checklist format with Task IDs, story labels, and parallelization markers
- Phase structure: Setup → Foundational → User Stories (4) → Polish
- Clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified
- All tasks include specific file paths and are independently testable
- Implementation strategy with MVP scope defined

The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3, P1) and include all required deliverables from the specification and plan documents. Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, and story labels where appropriate.

## Outcome

Successfully created the tasks.md file with 74 tasks organized in 7 phases. The breakdown covers all four chapters of Module 2 and includes setup, foundational, user story, and polish tasks. Each task is specific enough to be executed independently with clear file paths and dependencies documented.

## Evaluation

The task breakdown successfully implements all requirements from the specification and plan documents. It follows the required format with proper checklist formatting, story labels, and parallelization markers. The tasks are organized in a logical sequence that enables incremental development and testing of each user story.
