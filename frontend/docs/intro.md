# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Bridging Digital & Physical Worlds

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum for modern robotics development, covering everything from foundational ROS 2 concepts to advanced AI-powered robotics using NVIDIA Isaac.

## Course Modules

This curriculum is organized into three comprehensive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of modern robotics:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Foundational concepts of Robot Operating System 2
- Core entities: nodes, topics, services, and actions
- ROS 2 ecosystem and architecture
- Programming robots with rclpy
- Services and actions for complex robot interactions
- URDF anatomy for robot description

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Physics simulation with Gazebo
- Sensory apparatus integration
- High-fidelity Unity integration
- Simulation bridge technologies
- Creating realistic digital twins

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - *NEW*
- **Isaac Sim Omniverse Setup**: Setting up NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic rendering and physics
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Using Isaac Sim Replicator to generate labeled training data (RGB + Segmentation) with domain randomization
- **Visual SLAM Implementation**: Implementing Visual SLAM using Isaac ROS GEMs on the GPU for real-time mapping and localization
- **Navigation Stack Configuration**: Configuring the Navigation 2 stack for humanoid path planning and obstacle avoidance

## About Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain

Module 3 represents the cutting edge of AI-powered robotics, leveraging NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem to create intelligent robot brains capable of perception, mapping, and navigation. This module covers:

- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizing GPU-accelerated processing with Isaac ROS GEMs
