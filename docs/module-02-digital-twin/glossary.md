# Glossary: Simulation Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity).

## A

**Asset** - A reusable component in Unity such as a 3D model, texture, material, or prefab that represents objects in the simulation environment.

## B

**Bridge** - A communication layer that enables data exchange between ROS 2 and simulation environments (Gazebo or Unity), translating message formats and protocols between systems.

## C

**Collision Geometry** - The simplified geometric representation of a robot or object used for physics calculations and collision detection in simulation.

## D

**Digital Twin** - A virtual replica of a physical robot that mirrors its behavior, appearance, and interactions in a simulated environment for testing and validation purposes.

## F

**Friction Coefficient** - A dimensionless scalar value that represents the resistance to sliding between two surfaces in contact, used in physics simulation to model realistic interactions.

## G

**Gazebo** - An open-source physics-based simulation environment that provides realistic robot simulation with accurate physics, sensor modeling, and rendering capabilities.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** - A sensor that measures angular velocity, linear acceleration, and sometimes magnetic field to determine orientation and motion of a robot.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)** - A sensor technology that measures distances by illuminating a target with laser light and analyzing the reflected light to create 3D maps of the environment.

## P

**Physics Engine** - Software that simulates the behavior of objects according to the laws of physics, including gravity, friction, collision detection, and response.

**Plugin** - A modular software component in Gazebo that extends functionality, commonly used to add sensors, controllers, or custom behaviors to simulated robots.

## R

**ROS-TCP-Connector** - A Unity package that enables communication between Unity and ROS 2 using TCP/IP protocol for bidirectional message exchange.

**ros_gz_bridge** - A ROS 2 package that facilitates communication between ROS 2 and Gazebo, translating message types and managing data flow between the systems.

## S

**Sensor Simulation** - The process of modeling physical sensors in a virtual environment to generate realistic data streams that mimic real-world sensor behavior.

**Split-Brain Architecture** - A simulation design pattern that separates physics simulation (Gazebo) and visualization (Unity) into independent but synchronized systems for optimal performance.

## T

**TF (Transform)** - The system used in ROS to keep track of coordinate frames in a robot system over time, allowing for spatial relationships between different parts of the robot and environment.

**Topic** - A named bus over which nodes exchange messages in ROS, used for asynchronous communication between different components of the simulation system.

## U

**Unity Robotics Hub** - A collection of tools, components, and examples that enable robotics simulation and development within the Unity game engine.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** - An XML format for representing robot models, including kinematic and dynamic properties, visual appearance, and sensor configurations.

## V

**Visualization** - The rendering of simulated environments and robot states in a graphical format that allows users to observe and interact with the simulation.

## X

**Xacro** - An XML macro language that extends URDF, allowing for more concise and reusable robot descriptions through parameterization and macro definitions.
